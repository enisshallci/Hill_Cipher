# Hill Cipher Implementation

This repository contains the implementation of the Hill Cipher, a classical encryption algorithm based on linear algebra concepts. The cipher uses a square matrix as the key and operates by performing matrix multiplication on plaintext messages to produce ciphertext.

## Description

The Hill Cipher is a polygraphic substitution cipher that encrypts blocks of text using matrix multiplication. It requires a key matrix, which is a square matrix of size `n x n`. The plaintext is grouped into blocks of size `n`, and matrix multiplication is applied between the key matrix and the plaintext matrix to generate the ciphertext.

### Files:

- `HilCipherImplementation.java`: Contains the implementation of the cipher (encryption and decryption 2x2) using Java.
- `HillCipher.cpp`: Contains the implementation of the cipher (encryption and decryption 3x3) using C++.
